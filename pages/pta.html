                    <b>The Parent Teacher Association (PTA)</b> has been established to bring together parents and teachers on each campus to support the college and assist us to continue to provide a high quality and broad education for our students.
                    A committee for each campus, to represent the parent bodies in working with the schoolâ€™s administration and teachers, is elected annually at Annual General Meetings. Each consists of a minimum of four members, all of whom have children
                    enrolled in the campus.

                    <b>The Old Student Association (OSA).</b> These associations often organize social events, publish newsletters or magazines, and raise funds for the organization. Many provide a variety of benefits and services that help alumni maintain
                    connections to their educational institution and fellow graduates. In the US, most associations do not require its members to be an alumnus of a university to enjoy membership and privileges.
